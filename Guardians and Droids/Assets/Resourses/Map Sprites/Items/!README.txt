~~~~~A SPECIAL NOTE ON THE RED CROSS SYMBOL

The red cross is a protected symbol in international and some regional laws, and several Red Cross organizations take the stance that it is not appropriate to use the symbol in video games. I feel this is rather absurd given the completely different domains and what the red cross actually symbolizes in games (healing), as well as how accepted it is as a symbol of healing within and without games... but in a litigation-friendly society, it pays to be careful. You'll notice the actual medkits use green and yellow crosses instead (a magenta or deep orange cross was also considered but ultimately not used).

There is one icon which is quite similar to the red cross- the healing icon. Specifically, the protected red cross symbol is defined as a red cross on a white background, preferably composed of four squares. The similar symbol is a stylized magenta cross with different proportions and effects, with outline and on a transparent background. Note that in Ascension 2 it's actually red and this version has been recoloured with the colours from Ascension Adventure 2 because I'm paranoid. The original colours are #CB2337 (dark pink), #E76408 (light pink), and #FBE6F6 (white). The original orange-red is probably actually further away from a true red cross but the pink looks less red. I don't believe this symbol is infringing even with the original colours but be careful with any edits you make to it.

~~~~~A SPECIAL NOTE ON THE SNIPER SCYTHE AND WRECKING BAR

These are intended as homages/references to other media. I do not believe they are infringement in and of themselves but (as with anything) how you use them could make them infringing.

A crowbar is a fairly generic tool with many uses in games and in the real world. If you have a character named Gordon Freeman who is a scientist that uses the crowbar to beat up aliens, it's probably a copyright violation. If you have a character named Jordan Frohman who is an idiot scientist that uses the crowbar to beat up aliens to no effect, it would probably be considered parody. If you have a crowbar item used to open a cupboard in an adventure game where you must escape a house, it's a non-issue.

The sniper scythe in particular is very similar to a very specific weapon- Crescent Rose from RWBY. It's pretty low-res and not a hugely faithful reproduction and could be interpreted simply as a red scythe. If you describe it as a sniper scythe that folds up into a rifle and is used by a Huntress named Ruby Rose to kill Grimm, it's probably a copyright violation. If you use it as a farming implement or an engine component, it's probably okay.

You may ask, well, shouldn't OpenGameArt only have art which is guaranteed to be non-infringing? The simple fact is that nothing is completely safe and it often depends on how you use a piece of art. On the other hand, don't let the scary warnings stop you from making what you want to make. For what it's worth, I consider everything in this pack safe by any reasonable standard.
